# StudyGator Repository
This repository contains the `frontend` and `backend` for StudyGator.

## Getting Started
### Installing dependencies
There are two dependencies needed to run this:
* Golang: 1.22.1 (Download from here and run installer: https://go.dev/dl/)
* NodeJS: 20.11.1 LTS (Download from here and run installer: https://nodejs.org/en)

Once those are installed, you can enter the directory of this repository in a terminal and run the following:
```bash
# Backend Init
cd backend/
go mod tidy

# Frontend Init
cd ..
cd frontend/
npm install
```
### Running the App
I've already gone ahead and configured everything to make it easy to run, as such all you need to do is:

In one terminal run:
```bash
cd backend/
go run server.go
```

Then in another terminal run:
```bash
cd frontend/
npm run dev
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:5173 to view the app! Or go to http://localhost:8080 for the GraphQL Playground (API Tester).
### GQLGEN
If you make any changes to .graphqls files in `backend` you need to run the following to update the autogenerated code:
```bash
cd backend/
go generate ./...
```
